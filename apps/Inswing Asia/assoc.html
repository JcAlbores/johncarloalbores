                Association football, also known as "footy" or "footie" and "soccer", is a sport typically played by 11 players for each team, one of those is the goalkeeper. Players should kick the ball toward a goal, playing the sport by hands are strictly prohibited and will cause a foul to the player who does it, of course, with the exception for the goalkeepers who are the only one allowed for touching the ball by hands. This sport can be played indoors and outdoors, even in beach, swamp and snow! <br><br>
