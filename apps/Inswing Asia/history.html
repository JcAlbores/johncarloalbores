            <p class="ti">Football History</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Numerous game variations of football were recorded even in the early times. The primitive football types were said to be more violent and more disorganized, games were even played by any number of players with any means, except of manslaughter and murder, to get the ball from its opponent. Despite of having the fact that people have enjoyed kicking a ball for thousand of years, the football history formally began in England, 1863, when rugby and association football were introduced as a branch of the sport. This is the time when the Football Association in England, the first governing body of football, was founded. 
<br><br>
The first version of football that has its regular rules was during the Han dynasty, during the second and third centuries BC in China. This first recognized football game was called Cuju, Tsu' Chu or Zuqiu. Tsu' Chu was played with a leather ball stuffed with feathers and hair through an opening, 30-40cm in measurement. The ball should be kicked into a small net tied into long bamboo canes in order to count as a goal, using of hands were not allowed in this game.
<br><br>
Another game, named "kemari", was recorded during the Asuka Period in Japan. The players should stand in a circle and pass the ball to each other without letting the ball touch the ground. It is still played today in Japan during festivals.
<br><br>
A Greek team game known as "episkyros" is also another early form of football recognized by FIFA. Episkyros was played by two teams on a rectangular field with boundary line marks and a center line, with a smaller ball. The game was said to be remained popular for 700-800 years.
<br><br>
As the 19th century progresses, football gradually became the common sports in public schools, resulting to have more and more innovations and refinement of the game as time pass by. In fact, each school developed their own standards and adaptation of the sport.
