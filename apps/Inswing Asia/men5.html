        <div class="men">

            <p>Selangor FA squeezed into the Malaysia FA Cup
semiﬁnals after they upstaged a heartbroken Kuala
Lumpur FA 8-7 on penalties in a dramatic ending to a
pulsating match on Saturday. <br> <br>
The defeat was cruel on Kuala Lumpur, who overturned
the 3-0 ﬁrst leg defeat to score three goals inside 90
minutes. <br> <br>
Firdaus Mohd Faudzi was the unfortunate player who
will have a sleepless night after seeing his penalty saved
by Khairulazhan Khalid. <br> <br>
Selangor will now go on to face PKNS FC in a two
legged semiﬁnal, after the club side defeated Perak on
aggregate in the other match. <br> <br>
           Kuala Lumpur were without suspended top goalscorer
Guilherme De Paula for this game but were boosted by
the return of the in-form Zaquan Adha, who was tasked
as the lone striker upfront.<br> <br>
The City Hawks absorbed some early Selangor pressure
before taking a 15 minute lead through Zaquan, who
tapped home after great work from Ashri Chuchu on the
right.<br> <br>
Ashri almost doubled their lead minutes later, but the
midﬁelder was denied by a point blank save from
Khairulazhan.<br> <br>
The Selangor custodian was again called into action in
the 38 minute, pulling oa a ﬁngertip save to deny Indra
Putra Mahayuddin from a free-kick.<br> <br>
But just as the Red Giants thought of heading into the
break with some breathing space, Kuala Lumpur
doubled their lead with practically the last kick of the
ﬁrst half.<br> <br>
Paulo Josue was the scorer, the Brazilian steaming into
the penalty box to guide a header past Khairulazhan
was Indra had planted a perfect cross for him.
Kuala Lumpur’s comeback was complete in the 54
minute when Syazwan Andik had all the time in the
world to breeze past a statuesque Selangor defence to
steer home.<br> <br>
That equalizer on aggregate forced Selangor to come
out of their shell, and Khatul Anuar pulled oa two
outstanding saves to deny headers from Sean Eugene
Selvaraj and Ruﬁno Segovia.<br> <br>
Kuala Lumpur had most of the possession and chances
after that, but failed to score again, and the lottery of a
penalty shootout loomed.
